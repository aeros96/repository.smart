OpenWizard

# This project is no longer in development by the original developer, but is still being updated by others who use it.

OpenWizard was originally created to help the Kodi community out and help get rid of the broken personal wizards that are floating around. As this is a work in progress, a repository is highly recommended, but if you prefer not to, there is a built-in auto-updater.

For more information on how to edit/customize this wizard for your own usage, please read [the wiki](https://github.com/drinfernoo/plugin.program.openwizard/wiki).

Currently, this version of the wizard supports Kodi 19 and 20 with the following:

If you don't see these in your menus, don't be alarmed... it's just because you dont have them installed. They are supported, however ;)
